# Field Background Image - Complete Setup Instructions

## 🎉 **Home Screen Updated for Field Background!**

### **What I've Done:**
- ✅ Added background image layer to home screen
- ✅ Added green overlay (85-90% opacity) for text readability  
- ✅ Configured proper layering and effects
- ✅ Updated `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`

## 📸 **Next Step: Add Your Image**

### **Step 1: Get Your Image**
Take a photo or find an image of a dirt path through sugarcane fields (like the one you showed me).

### **Step 2: Save the Image**
1. Name the file: `field_background.jpg`
2. Save it to the `assets` folder in your project
3. Full path: `assets/field_background.jpg`

### **Step 3: The Image Should Be:**
- **Format**: JPG, JPEG, or PNG
- **Size**: 1920x1080 pixels or larger (recommended)
- **Quality**: High quality for best results

### **Step 4: Restart Your App**
The app is already configured! Just restart it:

```bash
# Stop the current app (press 'q' in terminal or close browser)
# Then restart:
flutter run -d chrome --web-port=3000
```

## ✅ **What You'll See:**

Once you add the image:
- ✨ Beautiful field path image as background
- 🟢 Green tint overlay matching your farm theme
- 📱 All content readable and professional-looking
- 🎨 Perfect agricultural aesthetic

## 💡 **Temporary Fallback:**

If the image isn't added yet, the home screen will show a gradient background. The system won't crash - it just won't show the field background until you add the image.

**Status**: ✅ Code ready, waiting for your image!  
**Action Needed**: Add `field_background.jpg` to the `assets` folder
